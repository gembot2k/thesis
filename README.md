# Thesis
Contactless Respiratory Rate Measurement with FMCW Radar and XGBoost


## Projects Structure
### code
It contains Python and Jupyter code, from data acquisition to respiratory rate predictions using various ML models, including XGBoost.

### dataset
This dataset contains Raw data from FMCW radar (IQ files) split into radar-train and radar-test. Both datasets will be used for Machine Learning training and testing to predict the respiratory rate.
